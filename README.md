# Learning React

## What do I know vs. Not know

Know: 

* React is a library not a framework
* Class vs. Function components
* How to show a component with React.DOM
* How to communicate between components
* How a component updates itself
* That React uses a virtual dom
* That JSX html builds non-basic HTML
  * ex. validation form
* Inline styling in JSX
* This axios ajax call + promise

Not know: 

* How to 
  * Build
  * Test
  * Use TypeScript
  * Route
  * Base this on a server-side thing
  * Base this on Azure Functions(?)
  * Base this on Haskell server-side
* How rich can JSX get?
* Is there non-css non-inline styling?
* What else can axios do?
  * Once again, how is it possible that we did an ajax
    call to a site that is not ours?
